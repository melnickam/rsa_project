    "This notebook contains a program that implements the RSA encryption algorithm to encrypt and decrypt messages and ciphers. RSA is a technique that takes two public keys, n and e, and encrypts a message M by performing M^e mod n. A private key, d, can be used to reverse the process to yield the message, M, from the cipher, C (M = C^d mod n). The reason this is effective is that you can publish the public keys, allowing other people to send you encrypted messages. Nobody will be able to determine what d is unless they can determine the prime factors of n. With a large enough n, this becomes practically impossible with the computational resources available today.\n",

    "\n",
    "This was a very challenging and rewarding project!\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial challenge was simply in understanding RSA. The biggest leap here for me came from seeing the math done on a small scale. Ben kim posted this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8M2BTscoD4 which was very helpful for understanding RSA. An anonymous poster in piazza @131 made an analogy to the public keys being more akin to an \"envelope\" than a message was also incredibly helpful. The official class videos on RSA and all of the individual algorithms (EEA, FME, binary conversion) were also invaluable, as were the MIT lecture notes (which Kevin Vick attested to, convincing me to check them out more fully). I'm glad I had made a version of Square and Mod for the problem set, because it helped not having a full algorithm to follow in order to help me understand what is happening in Siriam's FME algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the most challenging of the basic algorithms was the one used to compute bezout coefficients. I spent a lot of time trying to make sure the two inputs for the gcd(a,b) portion were in order (larger, smaller) as this was emphasized in the lectures. As a result of my tortured attempts to keep everything straight, I often ended up with the coefficients being reversed at the end. Here's where I realized the value of *understanding* something rather than simply applying it, as for a computer it does not matter which order the inputs are in! The first round of EEA simply reverses the two inputs without changing them if they are out of order. The tip to keep them in order was meant to help us perform the calculations by hand. By deciding to do a few test cases, I realized this and the algorithm was much easier to build.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will say, one of the more frustrating parts of this particular project is that n is used as a key term in RSA (the public key) and is also used as a standard \"input\" variable in python (for example in the FME algorithm demonstrated in the lectures.) Looking back over the code, it can be difficult to discern if a certain n is n, the public key, or just n, a generic stand-in. In the future, I will probably rely on more descriptive terms in my functions to avoid this confusion!\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other mistakes and what I learned from each:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Forgetting to copy n, e, or d into the function when encoding or decoding messages on Piazza. This was a simple mistake with a simple correction, however seeing how each of those pieces (n, e, and d) had to be correct for the message to come out in plaintext at the end underscored how each one was uniquely built in relation to the others. This helped solidify the prerequisites of each (i.e. e is pairwise prime to (p-1)(q-1) or d is modular inverse to e.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* I attempted to make a square root function that relied on Newton's Method because I thought it might be similar to the native python modulus operator and FME, where there was a more efficient way for large numbers particularly when I only needed the units level of precision. The method worked, but seemed to take slightly longer than math.sqrt, so I abandoned it. I would like to find a source for how the simple python functions work to determine if there is room for building more efficiency or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A mistake that helped me a lot with my understanding of the project was anothers: another student had posted on piazza with an encoded message and her keys. I was able to decode it as with other messages, but when I tried to encode a response, it came out as gibberish when I tested it by decoding the response again. At first, I assumed this was my mistake, but other messages still worked fine. Then, I wanted to let her know, but without posting something in the open. This lead me to try to figure out how to reverse engineer the e public key. I already had a function that would give me d. I thought I could use d to determine the modular inverse, but realized that this required knowledge of (p-1)(q-1). Using my factoring function instead of my Force_d function, I could identify the p and then use n / p to find q, then use p and q to generate a new e based on the given n. It wasn't until I went through this process that I really understood how all the different pieces together. Later on, when I built my main function, I used this experience to help figure out how to automatically generate an e, given a user-provided n. (It also caused me to rewrite the list that contained n, e, and d to also include p and q! It is useful to know p and q and hard to recover them!)\n",
    "\n",
    "A general software development lesson learned was that building a script to read codes from text files or a basic main function should be done early! It is so much easier to test everything if you don't have to copy and paste keys from one code block to another and between two open internet browsers.\n",

Then, in Factorize_Improved, I test only the prime numbers on that list for divisibility. This reduced the time to factor by skipping numbers that will not be factors (since they themselves have prime factors) and stopping at square root n (before which, there must be a prime factor if the number is composite according to THM 2.)\n",

The advantage of the list is that, once generated, it can be reused for any n smaller than the initial input. Were I to build it again, I think I would integrate the process so that as the prime list was built, it tested n for factors every 5000 primes or so.

I added it to the main function as an option for decryption so users can avoid typing in n, e, and d manually.\n",

I do like that on startup it initializes a new n, e, and d so users can jump into encrypting a message or soliciting one with only a couple key presses.\n",

As it is now, when it needs to grow it starts back from 2 again. I would also try to implement hyperthreading into that algorithm as it is the most resource-intensive portion of the entire project.\n",

I then essentially noticed the example algorithms started from the same, simple number (1 or 2) and modified my code to match. That worked much better.\n",
